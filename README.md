# 🧠 Support Operations Simulator

**Goal:** Analyse customer support efficiency and identify factors causing SLA breaches using Python and data analytics.  

---

## 📊 Overview

This project simulates a customer support environment where each ticket has:
- Priority level (High / Medium / Low)
- Channel (Chat, Email, Phone)
- SLA target (hours)
- Response and resolution times

The objective is to find **which regions and priorities breach SLAs most** and propose data-driven improvements.

---

## 🧮 Tools & Skills
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Google Colab
- Data cleaning & time-based calculations
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualisation & KPI analysis

---

## 📈 Key Insights
| Metric | Finding |
|---------|----------|
| Overall SLA Breach Rate | ~30% |
| Highest Breach Region | EU |
| Highest Breach Priority | High |
| Recommendation | Add one EU support shift & streamline high-priority workflows |

## 🧠 Reflection
This project demonstrates my ability to use **data to solve operational problems**, automate metrics tracking, and communicate insights visually — key skills for Strategy & Operations roles at fintech firms like **Revolut**.
